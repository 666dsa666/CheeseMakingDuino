# CheeseMakingDuino

CheeseMakingDuino is a personal project to help the cheese production process.

CheeseMaking is not so hard, and to get good result, humidity and temperature need to be controlled carefully.

Here is what I will be using for this project :
- Arduino Uno
- LCD Keypad
- DHT11/DHT22 Sensor
- Dual Relay board
- A humidifier
- A heat bed ? Not sure about what I'll be using.

19/04/2016 : The project is now finished, enhancements could easily be done, but it's working so... That's it for me !

08/04/2016 : Initial upload, not tested. Compile but might not work correctly.

Enhancements are greatly appreciated and as I cannot test the code, Issue reporting would really help.
