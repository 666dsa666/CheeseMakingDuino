# CheeseMakingDuino

CheeseMakingDuino is a personal project to help the cheese production process.

CheeseMaking is not so hard, and to get good result, humidity and temperature need to be controlled carefully.

Here is what I will be using for this project :
- Arduino Uno
- LCD Keypad
- DHT11 Sensor
- Dual Relay board
- An humidifier
- A heat bed ? Not sure about what I'll be using.
